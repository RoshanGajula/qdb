# Differences between Angular JS 1 and Angular 2

- Angular JS uses Javasript, Angular2 Uses Typescript.
- Angular 1 is controller based, Angular 2 is component based.
- 

# Differences between Angular 2, 4 and 6 

2.0 to 4.0 has reduced itâ€™s bundled file size by 60%.

# Why Angular 

# Main features of Angular
SPA
Dependency Injection 
Dynamic Loading
Templating
Directives
Dynamic Component Loading
Lazy Loading

# What is dependency injection
DI is a coding pattern in which a class asks for dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.
Dependencies are services or objects that a class needs to perform its function. 
In Angular, the DI framework provides declared dependencies to a class when that class is instantiated.
The DI framework lets you supply data to a component from an injectable service class, defined in its own file.
The @Injectable() decorator marks it as a service that can be injected && Angular dependency injector is responsible for creating service instances and injecting them into classes.

# Inversion of control (IOC)

# Lazy Loading

# Tree Shaking
Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript context for dead-code elimination. It relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax, i.e. import and export. It removes any unused code i.e which are not imported while building.




# Angular Bootstrap process / What is angular bootstrapping

# What is a module
A module is basically a container to group components, services, directives etc.

# JavaScript Modules vs. NgModules

# Module Syntax / Options / Create Custom module


# What is a component

# Dynamic Component Loading

# Component Syntax / Options

# Component Life Cycle Hooks

# Dynamic Component Loader



# Type of directives / structural & attribute directives diff & syntax

# Directive Definition & Create Custom Directive

# Pipe Definition & Create Custom pipe

# Events in Angular / EventEmitter

# InBuild Directives in Angular
```
*ngFor
*ngIf
<div [ngSwitch]="conditionExpression">
<ng-template [ngSwitchCase]="case1Exp">...</ng-template>
<ng-template ngSwitchCase="case2LiteralString">...</ng-template>
<ng-template ngSwitchDefault>...</ng-template>
</div>
<div [ngClass]="{'active': isActive, 'disabled': isDisabled}">
<div [ngStyle]="{'property': 'value'}">
